This mobile phone detector can sense the presence of an activated mobile phone from a distance of four to five metres.
So it can come handy in an examination hall or meetings where mobile phones are not permitted.
The circuit can detect incoming and outgoing calls, SMS, even if a mobile phone is kept in silent mode.
When it detects an RF signal from an activated mobile phone, its LED starts blinking and continues to blink until the signal stops.
